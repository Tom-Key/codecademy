### Manipulation

- `ls -a`
    - The `-a` is called an option
    - `-a` - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
    - `-l` - lists all contents of a directory in long format, as well as the file permissions
    - `-t` - orders files and directories by the time they were last modified.
    - Combining Options: `ls -alt`

- `cat` The cat command outputs the contents of a specified file

- cp `cp`  copies files or directories
    - `cp file1.txt file2.txt my_directory/ `To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory as the last argument
    
- **Wildcards**

- `mv` moves a file without making a copy.

- `rm` deletes files and directories.
    - The `-r` stands for “recursive,” and it’s used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.
