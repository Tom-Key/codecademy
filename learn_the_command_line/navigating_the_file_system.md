- `ls`：the command line looks at the directory you are in, and then “lists” all the files and directories inside of it
- `pwd`:It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.
- `cd`: change directory, switches you into the directory you specify.
    - move up one directory, we use `cd ..`(level up)
- `mkdir`  making directories
- `touch` create new filespwd

- MacOS version 10.15 (Catalina) and higher uses a similar, but slightly different default shell called Z shell or Zsh. In most ways Zsh is an exact replacement for Bash, so there is no need to switch over or install Bash instead.
