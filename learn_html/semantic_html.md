### Senmantic HTML
- Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
- `header` and `nav`
- `main` and `footer`
    - main:encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage
- `<article>` and `<section>`
- the `aside` element
    - is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isnâ€™t required in order to understand the main content.Some common uses of the `<aside>`element are for:
        - Bibliographies
        - Endnotes
        - Comments
        - Pull quotes
        - Editorial sidebars
        - Additional information
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- `<audio>` and [Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio#Attributes)
    ``` html
    <audio autoplay controls>
      <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
    </audio>
    ```
- `video`
    - `controls`/`autoplay`/`loop`
- `<embed>` is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as video, audio and img, should be used in its place, but is being taught for legacy purposes.
