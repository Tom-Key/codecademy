### Git Teamwork

- `git clone remote_location clone_name`
    - `clone_name` is the name you give to the directory in which Git will clone the repository.
    
- `git remote -v`:list of a Git projectâ€™s remotes
    - Git automatically names this remote `origin`
    
- `git fetch`:bring the changes down to your local copy

- `git merge origin/master`
    - those commits are on the `origin/master` branch. Your local master branch has not been updated yet
    
- `git push origin your_branch_name`
    - push your branch up to the remote
